Since downloading Xcode and upgrading my Atom text editor to run scripts, I have gone back hrough all of the Swift lessons on the Mimo app. I have been running each code provided in the lessons through Xcode and in Atom, to better learn the language. I have added these files to this repository as well (Swift Basics and Swift Core).

Completed first project on Mimo app for building an iOS app. Used Xcode to experiment with a Swift playground. Below challenges completed for project

Bronze:
Add an else if block to code that prints "Second try!" to the console if the number variable equals 11

Silver:
Get rid of \n at the end of the text printed to the console. Used terminator attribute

Gold:
Make the number variable a tuple with two Int-type values. Modify the if statement to trigger only when both members are equal to 10. Used logical operators both members of the tuple.
